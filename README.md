# Goat Circuits Business Website

A small businesses founded in San Jose, California in 2022. The client reached out expressing his desire to have a simple front-facing website simply describing his business. He wanted the ability for prospective clients to contact him via an email form. He also wanted to ensrue that it integrated with his existing Google business suite gmail account. Lastly, a logo design and headshot was commissioned based on what he was looking for and his chosen color palette.

## Process

The site had been built using React and Tailwind. React was used for it's optimized performance and quick iteration. Due to its modularity, scaling up with the addition of use cases will be more streamlined. Tailwind had been chosen due to its "utility-first" philosophy amd quick iteration which allowed less CSS to be written. EmailJS was the chosen technology to integrate email forms with the clients existing Google business suite. This had been challenging to implement due to a lack of documentation. However, with a lot of trail and error, time and studying, emails successfully arrived in the client's inbox. Lastly, the client's website is hosted on Netlify. This was chosen due to it's out-of-the-box CI/CD infrastrcuture which allowed for quick deployment if necessary.
